used the ocr_requiremnts.txt with opencv-headless edited with opencv-python -->ocr and opencv-python both worked
2.installed ultralytics also to the testenv1 environmnt ---->still working

but not using cuda

tried installing pytorch cuda17 but it alters ocr requirements. pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
torchaudio 2.0.2+cu117 requires torch==2.0.1, but you have torch 1.8.1 which is incompatible.


Solved above
by installing pytorch as normal then pip installing easyocr-->ocr is using cuda time take is 0.03 seconds


to make easy
use this requirements.txt
(torch's and torch vision's cu17 at the end was removed from cuda_ocr_requires.txt and python-headless was changed to opencv-python-->cuda_ocr_opencv_requires.txt)
"C:\Users\shitosu\Desktop\Mini_project\Programming\requirements\cuda_ocr_opencv_requires.txt"
and then pip3 install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
 
it works
